(ns smeltrefine.sim
  "Demo driver -- `clojure -M:dev:run`. Walks a clean smelting-refining
  plant through intake -> maintenance scheduling (escalate/approve) ->
  safety-concern flag (escalate/approve) -> shipment coordination
  (escalate/approve), then shows HARD-hold scenarios: a mis-wired
  request whose own `:effect` is not `:propose`, an unrecognized op,
  maintenance scheduled against an UNVERIFIED/unregistered equipment
  unit, a shipment coordinated against an UNVERIFIED/unregistered
  batch, a shipment proposal that would exceed the batch's own logged
  production weight, a proposal that tries to ACTUATE the smelting
  furnace, refining furnace, electrolytic refining cell, or converter
  directly (permanently blocked, no override), a double-schedule of
  the same maintenance window, a production-batch patch with a
  fabricated purity grade, and a production-batch patch with an
  implausible impurity-rate reading.

  Like every sibling actor's own demo, each check is exercised directly
  and independently below, one request per HARD-hold scenario, the SAME
  'exercise the failure mode directly, never only via a happy-path
  actuation' discipline `parksafety`'s ADR-2607071922 Decision 5 and
  every sibling since establish."
